## Git vs. GitHub
#### Git
* Git is version control, meaning it keeps what we call "snapshots" of code
   * it keeps copies of your old code
* Git does not rquire github
* git runs in the commandline
* In git, you have a **directory** of files  

_"git is like a family photographer, it shows change over time"_ - Mr. Mueller  

Think of this as when you are 
Intitializing git is like hiring a photographer, you only do it once in the beginning, we call an initialized git a repository  
Adding files to the staging area is like putting people in ther frame of the photo, it gets them ready, but doesnt actually take the picture yet.  
Commiting your file is the part where you take the snapshot, or the picture in this scenario  
**NEVER EVER** type Git init into your workspace*

#### Github
* _requires_ Git
* allows you to easily collaborate on projects
* stores code in the cloud
* Visually tracks changes
* also runs in the command line
